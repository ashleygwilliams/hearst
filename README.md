#win
Turn NY Fashion Week — or any event — into a game that leverages and influences social publishing trends with, #win, our virtual leaderboard. The game begins when editors populate the game environment with relevant hashtags directly from the Hearst CMS using article keywords and categories. Our app then weights and ranks the timeliness and popularity of these tags, as well as individual user's influence and activity against these tags. From there, the game is driven by an emergent dialogue between editors and social media users, as they create and contribute tagged content in a real-time race to be the one who knew first and knew best. An event-driven, topical scavenger hunt. A race to create and distribute relevant, influential content. Be ready. Be relevant. #win
